# openview - A modern image gallery

Design criteria:

* Modern look, low distraction, high usability user interface. 
* Low-effort: Serves images from directory. Easy to deploy.
* Read-only, no database, only caches.
* Modern language.
* Avoid reinventing the wheel.
* Focus on stable and secure source code.
* Self-hostable.

The frontend was inspired by [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/)'s low-distraction image wall, [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/)'s elegant layout and [fgallery](https://www.thregr.org/~wavexx/software/fgallery/)'s minimal UI.
